Bugs in the way .htaccess was handling the auto-version PHP code.

# Auto-versioning

PHP + .htaccess to auto-version CSS and JS

# Created a JS function called sticky buns 

This makes the right module "sticky" to the top of the browser window when scrolling past the top of the element.

# Tweaked the CSS 

Made the right module a static width, instead of fluid to the page's right margin
